# CarRental

This is a simple car rental interface in Java. You can create a new user and log into it.
You can see which branches the chain has, with opening times and locations. 
You can rent a car of your choosing, with all of it's details present in the booking window. You can use the filter option to find the car you are looking for.
If the car is free to rent it will assign it to you, but if it is already taken it will inform you as much.
